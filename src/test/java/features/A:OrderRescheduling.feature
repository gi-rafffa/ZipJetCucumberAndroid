Feature: Order rescheduling
	As a user I want to reschedule order in default city: different cases
  
Scenario Outline: Place an order will all default inputs in London and immediately reschedule DO to the next day
Given ZipJet, Simulator and Appium are running successfully, notifications are allowed
When I got started and use <city> default address 
	And Pick default timeslots and service-class
	And Fill correct random user data and save
	And Save address details
	And Fill correct Credit Card for <city> and save
	And Confirm Order
  And Close final splash
Then Order is placed and we continue test
  And Close RAF Pop Up
  And Open Edit order and reschedule it to the next day 
 Then Order is rescheduled 
  
Examples:
    | city    |  
    | Berlin  | 
    | London  | 
    | Paris   |
